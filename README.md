# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is one of the assignments from week two of coding bootcamp. After familiarizing ourselves with a helpful site called Bootstrap, students are assigned to apply bootstrap for their website. 

# Technology Used
Student designs the HTML and connects the Bootstrap link for the CSS style NAV Bar. Nav Bar gives the students a shortcut to construct a header.

# Thoughts
The process is simple but also tricky because for the HTML body part, student has to code a certain rows and columns in order to make the content looks good. After multiple tries, student is finally able to place the content in a great row and column. Challenge that the student encounters is since the bootstrap doesn't provide the footer, is it okay for student to code the footer himself?
